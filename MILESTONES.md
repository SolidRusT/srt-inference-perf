# srt-inference-perf Improvement Milestones

## Detailed Performance Metrics
- **Median and Percentiles**: Calculate and display median and percentile response times.
- **Error Analysis**: Include detailed error messages and reasons for failures.
- **Word Count**: Include the number of words generated in the response as part of the performance metrics.

## Improved Reporting
- **Summary Report**: Generate a summary report with overall statistics and comparisons between endpoints.
- **Export Options**: Allow users to export results in various formats (CSV, PDF).

## Enhanced Configuration
- **Dynamic Payloads**: Support dynamic payloads with placeholders that can be replaced with real data during tests.
- **Custom Headers**: Allow custom headers in requests for better flexibility.

## Advanced Load Testing
- **Concurrency Levels**: Test with different levels of concurrency to simulate real-world usage.
- **Ramp-up/Ramp-down**: Gradually increase/decrease the load to see how the system behaves under stress.

## User Interface Enhancements
- **Web Dashboard**: Provide a web-based dashboard to visualize performance metrics in real-time.
- **CLI Improvements**: Add more detailed progress indicators and summaries in the CLI.

## Integration with Monitoring Tools
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and visualization using the Prometheus exporter.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerting for specific performance thresholds (e.g., if response time exceeds a certain limit).

## Historical Data Analysis
- **Database Storage**: Store historical performance data in a database for trend analysis.
- **Comparison Over Time**: Compare current performance with historical data to identify trends and regressions.

## Documentation and Examples
- **Extensive Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation with examples and best practices.
- **Video Tutorials**: Create video tutorials to help users get started quickly.

## Authentication and Security
- **API Key Support**: Add support for API keys and other authentication mechanisms.
- **SSL/TLS**: Ensure all communications are secure by supporting SSL/TLS.

## Extensibility
- **Plugins**: Allow users to write plugins for custom metrics or integrations.
- **Configurable Metrics**: Let users define their own metrics and performance indicators.
